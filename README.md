# Notepad_DATASTRUCTURE_midPROJECT

There was coming some issue while pushing project file on github it was stucking on writting objects. So, added the code file manually.
Dowload it and run it in your [Visual Studio] or [VS code] or any c++ IDE.

Implementation using 4D- Linked List

Project Explanation:

Write a program to create a Note Pad using 4D linkedlist. The program should contain
following attributes. Each node includes four links left, right, top and bottom.
 Add text (Insert text at any particular position)

• User will input x and y position. Then input a string. You may use nodes of
characters or nodes for string for insertion.

 Delete text
• User will input a string. If the input string matches, delete all nodes which contains
the input string.

 Search Words
• User will input a string. If the input string matches, a message will be displayed
that string found with all positions if string exists multiple times.

 Copy text
• User will give the starting position x and y of string and end position of string and
then save the string into a string variable or character array with all special
characters.

 Past text
• After copy string, user will give the initial x and y position and then paste the
copied string at that position. If text already exists at the position where user want
to paste the copied text, then display a message “Text already found” with a
confirmation message that “Do you still want to paste the text”. If yes, then paste
the text from that particular position.

 Find a word and replace it
• Input a word. If word is found, then replace it. Choice will be given for first word
replacement or replace the word on whole file.

Undo text
• After performing any operation, it will be saved into a stack using a specific key.
 Count the total words
